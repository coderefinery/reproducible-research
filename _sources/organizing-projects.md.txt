# Organizing your projects

```{objectives}
- Understand how to organize research projects
- Get an overview of tools for collaborative and version controlled manuscripts
```

```{instructor-note}
- 10 min teaching incl. discussions
```

One of the first steps to make your work reproducible is to organize your projects well.
Let's go over some of the basic things which people have found to work (and not to work).


## Directory structure for projects

- Project files in a **single directory**
- **Different projects** should have **separate directories**
- Use **consistent and informative directory structure**
  - Avoid spaces in directory and file names – use `-`, `_` or CamelCase instead (nicer for computers to handle)
- If you need to separate public/private directories, 
  - put them separately in public and private Git repositories, or
  - use `.gitignore` to exclude the private information from being tracked
- Add a **README file** to describe the project and instructions on reproducing the results
- If you want to use the **same code in multiple projects**, host it on GitHub (or similar) and clone it into each of your project directories

A project directory can look something like this:

```shell
project_name/
├── README.md             # overview of the project
├── data/                 # data files used in the project
│   ├── README.md         # describes where data came from
│   └── sub-directory/       # may contain subdirectories
├── processed_data/       # intermediate files from the analysis
├── manuscript/           # manuscript describing the results
├── results/              # results of the analysis (data, tables, figures)
├── src/                  # contains all code in the project
│   ├── LICENSE           # license for your code
│   ├── requirements.txt  # software requirements and dependencies
│   └── ...
└── doc/                  # documentation for your project
    ├── index.rst
    └── ...
```

## Tracking source code, data, and results

- All code is version controlled and goes in the `src/` or `source/` directory
- Include appropriate LICENSE file and information on software requirements
- You can also version control data files or input files under `data/`
  - If data files are too large (or sensitive) to track, untrack them using `.gitignore`
- Intermediate files from the analysis are kept in `processed_data/`
- Consider using Git tags to mark specific versions of results (version
  submitted to a journal, dissertation version, poster version, etc.):
  ```console
  $ git tag -a thesis-submitted -m "this is the submitted version of my thesis"
  ```

## Excursion: Reproducible publications

### Discussion on collaborative writing of academic papers

````{discussion} Discuss in the collaborative document:

```
- How do you collaborate on writing academic papers?
  - ...
  - ...
  - (share your experience)

- How do you handle collaborative issues e.g. conflicting changes?
  - ...
  - ...
  - (share your experience)
```

````

-> Consider using **version control for manuscripts** as well. It may help you when keeping track of edits + if you sync it online then you don't have to worry about losing your work.

Version control does not have to mean git, but could also mean using "tracking changes" in tools like Word, Google Docs, or Overleaf (find links below).

### Tools for collaborative writing and version control of manuscripts

Git **can** be used to collaborate on manuscripts written in, e.g., LaTeX and other text-based formats. However it might not always be the most convenient. Other tools exist to make the process more enjoyable:

You can **collaboratively gather notes** using self-hosted or public instances of tools like [HedgeDoc](https://hedgedoc.org/) and [Etherpad](https://etherpad.org) or use online options like [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/), [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com) or the Microsoft online tools for easy and efficient collaboration. 

To format your notes into a manuscript, you can use Word-like online editors or tools like [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) (LaTeX) or [Typst](https://typst.app/) (markdown). Most of the tools in this section even provide a git integration.

[Manubot](https://github.com/manubot/rootstock) offers another way to turn your written word into a fully rendered manuscript using GitHub. 

### Executable manuscripts

You may also want to consider writing an executable manuscript using tools like [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org) hosted on [Binder](https://mybinder.org), [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), [Authorea](https://www.authorea.com) or [Observable](https://observablehq.com/), to name a few.

### Resources on research compendia

- [About research compendia at the Turing Way](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/compendia)
- ["Research compendia"](http://inundata.org/talks/rstd19/#/): a set of good practices for reproducible data analysis in R, but much is transferable to other languages.
- [rrtools](https://github.com/benmarwick/rrtools): instructions, templates, and functions for writing a reproducible article or report with R.

```{keypoints}
- An organized project directory structure helps with reproducibility.
- Also think about version control for writing your academic manuscripts.
