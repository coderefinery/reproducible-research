# Recording dependencies

```{questions}
- How can we communicate different versions of software dependencies?
```

```{instructor-note}
- 10 min teaching
- 10 min demo
```

Our codes often depend on other codes that in turn depend on other codes ...

- **Reproducibility**: We can version-control our code with Git but how should we version-control dependencies?
  How can we capture and communicate dependencies?
- **Dependency hell**: Different codes on the same environment can have conflicting dependencies.

## Tools and what problems they try to solve

**Conda, Anaconda, pip, virtualenv, Pipenv, pyenv, Poetry, requirements.txt,
environment.yml, renv**, ..., these tools try to solve the following problems:
- **Defining a specific set of dependencies**, possibly with well defined versions
- **Installing those dependencies** mostly automatically
- **Recording the versions** for all dependencies
- **Isolate environments**
  - On your computer for projects so they can use different software
  - Isolate environments on computers with many users (and allow self-installations)
- Using **different Python/R versions** per project
- Provide tools and services to **share packages**

Isolated environments are also useful because they help you make sure
that you know your dependencies!

**If things go wrong, you can delete and re-create** - much better
than debugging.  The more often you re-create your environment, the
more reproducible it is.

``````{challenge} Dependencies-1: Time-capsule of dependencies
Situation: 5 students (A, B, C, D, E) wrote a code that depends on a couple of libraries.
They uploaded their projects to GitHub. We now travel 3 years into the future
and find their GitHub repositories and try to re-run their code before adapting
it.

Answer in the collaborative document:

- Which version do you expect to be easiest to re-run? Why?
- What problems do you anticipate in each solution?

  `````{solution}
  **A**: It will be tedious to collect the dependencies one by one. And after
  the tedious process you will still not know which versions they have used.

  **B**: If there is no standard file to look for and look at and it might
  become very difficult for to create the software environment required to
  run the software. But at least we know the list of libraries. But we don't
  know the versions.
    
  **C**: Having a standard file listing dependencies is definitely better
  than nothing. However, if the versions are not specified, you or someone
  else might run into problems with dependencies, deprecated features,
  changes in package APIs, etc.
  
  **D** and **E**: In both these cases exact versions of all dependencies are
  specified and one can recreate the software environment required for the
  project. One problem with the dependencies that come from GitHub is that
  they might have disappeared (what if their authors deleted these
  repositories?).

  **E** is slightly preferable because version numbers are easier to understand than Git
  commit hashes or Git tags.

``````{challenge} Dependencies-2: Create a time-capsule for the future
Now we will demo creating our own time-capsule and share it with the future
world. If we asked you now which dependencies your project is using, what would
you answer? How would you find out? And how would you communicate this
information?

  `````{tabs}
    ````{group-tab} Conda
      We start from an existing conda environment. Try this either with your own project or inside the "coderefinery" conda
      environment. For demonstration puprposes, you can also create an environment with:

	  ```console
      $ conda env create -f myenv.yml
      ```
      Where the file `myenv.yml` could have some python libraries with unspecified versions:

      ```
      name: myenv
      channels:
        - conda-forge
        - defaults
      dependencies:
        - python=3.10
        - numpy
        - pandas
        - seaborn
      ```

      After creating the environment we can activate it with

      ```
      conda activate myenv
      ```

      Now we can freeze the environment into a new YAML file with:

      ```console
      $ conda env export > environment.yml
      ```

      Have a look at the generated file and discuss what you see.

      In the future — or on a different computer — we can re-create this environment with:
      
      ```console
      $ conda env create -f environment.yml
      ```

      What happens instead when you run the following command?

      ```console
      $ conda env export --from-history > environment_fromhistory.yml
      ```

    ````{group-tab} Python virtualenv
      Try this in your own project:
      ```console
      $ pip freeze > requirements.txt
      ```

      Have a look at the generated file and discuss what you see.

      In future you can re-create this environment with:
      ```console
      $ pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

    ````{group-tab} R
      This example uses renv.

      Try to "save" and "load" the state of your project library using
      `renv::snapshot()` and `renv::restore()`.
