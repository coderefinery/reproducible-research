```{admonition} A scary anecdote
- A group of researchers obtain great results and submit their work to a high-profile journal.
- Reviewers ask for new figures and additional analysis.
- The researchers start working on revisions and generate modified figures, but find inconsistencies with old figures.
- The researchers can't find some of the data they used to generate the original results, and
  can't figure out which parameters they used when running their analyses.
- The manuscript is still languishing in the drawer ...

## Why talking about reproducible research?

A 2016
[survey](http://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970)
in Nature revealed that irreproducible experiments are a problem across all
domains of science:

This study is now few years old but the highlighted problem did not get
smaller.

## Levels of reproducibility

A published article is like the top of a pyramid. It rests on multiple
levels that each contributes to its reproducibility.

This also means that you can think about it from the beginning of your research life cycle!

````{discussion} Discuss in collaborative document or with your team members
```markdown
- What are your experiences re-running or adjusting a script or a figure you
  created few months ago?
  - ...
  - ...
  - (share your experience)

- Have you continued working from a previous student's
  script/code/plot/notebook? What were the biggest challenges?
  - ...
  - ...
  - (share your experience, but constructively)
````

```{keypoints}
- Without reproducibility in scientific computing, everyone would have to start a new project / code from scratch
